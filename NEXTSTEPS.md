## How i approached the test

- Approaching the test i first had to have a read through what had been sent to me and get my head around what was being asked.

- I then read through the code and tried to work out what the codes functionality was and what was being displayed when it ran on a local server

- Once this was done i began working my way through the task that were set for me, which first involved writing the Explain.md file, this was then followed by seperating the components into seperate files.

- Once they were seperated i was then tasked with modifying the components to make them function based- however, this was where my first problem came into play. I had never seen or had to refactor class based components before. 

- So from here i had to research and work out what i had to do. This indeed took up a lot of my time and to keep to the 2 hours i decided to keep the functionality the same but rewrite the code slightly as well as refactoring, because this was more time efficient than going through all the code and refactoring everything

- Once this was done my time was limited and so i focused on testing the components using testing-library/react. I only managed to test one component due to spending a lot of time on working out ways to refactor.

## What i would do differently

- I think if i was to approach this test again knowing what i know now would be a few different ways of approaching depending on if i was confident on refactoring- i would either straight away rewrite the code but getting the same functionality in mind to save time, or if i was more confident in refactoring, then i would make sure id do it quicker to allow for more time testing.

## Improvements to the application

- I think general CSS could be used just to give it some character and depending on how complex the design is, shouldnt take too long (30mins-60mins)

- An authentication system which allows for a user to log in and store their Todo's - I have made a feature like this using firebase before, but as im not too familiar with backend it could take a while (120mins)
